# Integrated Case Study: Sea Food Cart Data Analysis
This repository contains an integrated case study using data from a seafood cart, demonstrating a complete data analysis workflow from raw data to business insights using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.
## Objective
The primary objective is to showcase proficiency across multiple data analysis tools by performing a comprehensive analysis of the Sea Food Cart's data. The goal is to identify key trends, measure performance metrics (KPIs), and generate actionable business insights to improve customer satisfaction and campaign effectiveness.
## Procedure
The analysis followed an integrated, multi-step process:

### Data Acquisition and Preparation:-
The raw data, provided in multiple CSV files, was imported and cleaned using Excel, transformed and manipulated using SQL, and prepared for visualization in Power BI's Power Query Editor.

### Data Analysis and KPI Calculation:-
Key metrics such as product views, cart adds, and purchases were calculated across all three platforms. In Excel, this involved using pivot tables and formulas. In SQL, this was done by creating summary tables and using aggregate functions. In Power BI, custom DAX measures were created for dynamic calculations.

### Visualization and Dashboard Creation:-
Excel was used to create static charts, while Power BI was utilized to build a fully interactive and dynamic dashboard, allowing for detailed exploration of the data.

### Insight Generation and Reporting:-
Insights were generated by interpreting the results from each tool. A final, unified report was compiled to provide a holistic view of the findings, including an assessment of data quality and campaign performance.

# Key Techniques
Excel:- Data Import and Cleaning, Pivot Tables and Charts, Slicers, and Formulas/Functions.
SQL:- Database creation (CREATE DATABASE), data transformation (ALTER TABLE), data joining (FULL JOIN), and data summarization (GROUP BY, CASE statements).
Power BI:- Data acquisition with Power Query, Data Modeling with table relationships, and creating custom measures with DAX.

## Results
The integrated analysis of the Sea Food Cart data revealed consistent and valuable insights across all three platforms:

### Data Quality Issue:- 
A significant finding was the presence of NULL values in the data, which were identified as a top performer for views and purchases. This suggests a data tracking issue that needs to be addressed for accurate reporting.

### Product Performance:- 
While NULL values were the most viewed and purchased, the analysis successfully identified Product ID 7 as the most added-to-cart product and also the most abandoned product. This indicates a potential issue with the product page or checkout process for this specific item.

### Overall Conversion Rates:- 
The overall view-to-purchase conversion rate was 25.17%, and the average cart-add-to-purchase conversion rate was 21.03%.

## Campaign Effectiveness:-
The analysis revealed a surprising trend: users who clicked on an ad impression had a lower purchase rate (35.12%) compared to those who did not have an impression at all (58.53%). This suggests that the ad campaigns may not be effectively targeted or that the user experience after clicking the ad needs improvement. The "Half Off - Treat Your Shellfish" campaign was the most successful, accounting for 78.24% of total campaign purchases.
